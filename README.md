# Arducam 5MP Plus Capture for Raspberry Pi Pico 2

This project provides a robust solution for capturing high-resolution JPEG images (up to 5MP) from an **Arducam Mini 5MP Plus (B0068)** module using a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2** (RP2350) or **Raspberry Pi Pico** (RP2040).

The system consists of an Arduino-based firmware for the Pico and a Python script for the host computer to trigger captures and retrieve image data.

## Features
- **Full 5MP Support**: Captured images at resolutions up to 2592x1944.
- **Hardware Stabilization**: Fixed timing and signal integrity issues present in official Arducam libraries when used with RP2040/RP2350.
- **Silent/Debug Modes**: Diagnostic logs can be toggled via software flags to streamline production use.
- **Clean Naming**: Automatic timestamped filenames (`img_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.jpg`).

## Hardware Setup

### Connection Pinout
| Camera Signal | Pico Pin (GP) | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| **CS**        | GP5           | Chip Select (SPI) |
| **MOSI**      | GP3           | Data In |
| **MISO**      | GP4           | Data Out |
| **SCK**       | GP2           | Clock |
| **GND**       | GND           | Ground |
| **VCC**       | 3V3           | Power (3.3V) |
| **SDA**       | GP8           | I2C Data |
| **SCL**       | GP9           | I2C Clock |

## Technical Implementation & Fixes
The primary objective of this project was to bridge the gap in the official Arducam drivers, which lacks native support for the Raspberry Pi Pico's RP2040/RP2350 architecture, even when using the Arduino IDE.

### Key Changes vs. Official Drivers:
1.  **VSYNC Polarity Hardlocking**: Fixed a common issue where the sensor's VSYNC pulses were missed by forcing active-low polarity in Register 0x03.
2.  **SPI Transaction Integrity**: Implemented `SPI.beginTransaction()` and `SPI.endTransaction()` within the critical data paths to prevent signal corruption during high-speed FIFO retrieval.
3.  **Explicit Pin Mapping**: Replaced default library assumptions with explicit RP2040 pin assignments (`Wire.setSDA/SCL`, `SPI.setRX/TX/SCK`).
4.  **Macro Collision Fixes**: Resolved naming conflicts (e.g., `CS` macro) that prevented the library from compiling on the Pico 2W.
5.  **FIFO Readout Optimization**: Enhanced the readout loop with proactive pointer resets to eliminate the "8-byte corruption" or "zero-byte data" issues common in early Pico-Arducam implementations.

## Getting Started

### 1. Arduino Firmware
1.  Open [pico_ov5642/pico_ov5642.ino](pico_ov5642/pico_ov5642.ino) in the Arduino IDE.
2.  Install the **Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040** board support package.
3.  Upload the sketch to your Pico.

### 2. Changing Resolution
To change the capture resolution, modify the `myCAM.OV5642_set_JPEG_size()` call in the `setup()` function of `pico_ov5642/pico_ov5642.ino`:

```cpp
// Example: Switch to UXGA (1600x1200)
myCAM.OV5642_set_JPEG_size(OV5642_1600x1200);

// Example: Switch to 5MP (2592x1944)
myCAM.OV5642_set_JPEG_size(OV5642_2592x1944);
```

Supported constants in `ArduCAM.h` include:
- `OV5642_320x240` (QVGA)
- `OV5642_640x480` (VGA)
- `OV5642_1024x768` (XGA)
- `OV5642_1600x1200` (UXGA)
- `OV5642_2592x1944` (5MP)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Higher resolutions result in larger files and longer transfer times. For 5MP images, the transfer can take ~20-30 seconds at 115200 baud.

### 3. Python Capture Script
1.  Ensure you have `pyserial` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pyserial
    ```
    *(Or use `uv add pyserial` if using the provided `uv` environment)*.
2.  Update `SERIAL_PORT` in `pico_ov5642/pico_capture_arducam5mp.py` to match your device (e.g., `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX` on Mac or `COMX` on Windows).
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python pico_ov5642/pico_capture_arducam5mp.py
    ```
